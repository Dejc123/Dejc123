Hi, I’m @Dejc123 👋  

- 👀 I’m interested in creating a decentralized freight exchange with utility token integration.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to connect web developers & blockchain developers to achieve this goal.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 2FA, web wallet, and staking features for the utility token with integration into a decentralized freight exchange.
